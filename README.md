# some-utils-test
some tests for `some-utils`

## I know
Using `yarn` with the js test suit of the npm inventor, really?

## Dev & test

```
yarn start
```

will execute `scripts/dev.mjs` which will watch two folder in `src`:
- `src/some-utils`: if any changes rebuild
- `src/some-tests`: if any changes run the tests
